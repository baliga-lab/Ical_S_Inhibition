## This repository contains processed data and code needed to generate figures for the manuscript *Sulfur metabolites play key system-level roles in modulating denitrification*
* There are three sepereate Jupyter notebooks, each containing python code associated with specific analyses (growth curves, metabolomics, and transcriptomics)
* All processed data tables can be found in the data folder
* Raw untargeted metabolomics data can be found at https://xcmsonline.scripps.edu/, in the XCMS Public section
* Raw sequencing data can be found in the NCBI GEO database (accession No.: GSE158822)
* Notebook PDFs are also included in case there are issues with rendering due to file size for those who want to view the code but do not want to download the repository
